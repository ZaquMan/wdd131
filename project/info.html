                    <h3>What is a Budget?</h3>
                    <p>
                        A budget is a tool for deciding how much money you will spend each month.  A budget shows how much 
                        money you make and how much money you plan to spend.  Ultimately, the goal is to help you understand
                        where your money is going.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Creating a budget can be broken into a few steps: List your expenses, list 
                        your income, and subtract the expenses from the income to see if you are spending too much.
                        If the difference is less than 0, then look at your expenses for things you can change, like 
                        reducing how much you spend on dining out.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Track Expenses</h3>
                    <p>
                        The first step of creating a budget is determining how you are currently spending your money.
                        Your bills, subscriptions, grocery shopping, and the occasional sweet treat are just a few
                        examples of some of the expenses that can easily go unnoticed but often build up over time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are many ways to track your expenses.  You can use a spreadsheet and log each expense
                        as it happens.  You can use the <a href="transactions.html">Transaction Tracker</a> page for
                        this, or any spreadsheet application.  Another option is to gather your bank statements and
                        work from what your bank has recorded for you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Regardless of which option you use, it is important to include all of your payments, no matter
                        how big or small.  Additionally, you need to make sure you're gathering a month's worth of expenses.

                <div>
                    <h3>List Income</h3>
                    <p>
                        Once you've gathered your expenses for the month, you need to do the same for your income.
                        This can be paychecks from a job, profits from selling items, or other forms of income.  While
                        it's important to not skip income sources, a common strategy is to work with your minimum
                        guaranteed income.  For example, if you work on commission, your income may change month to month.
                        In this case, you may want to stick to an averaged income amount based on several months.  Then
                        any extra income in one month can be saved for a month when you receive less than average.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Subtract Expenses from Income and Adjust</h3>
                    <p>
                        The last step of budgeting is to compare your expenses to your income and adjust your expenses
                        as needed.  Remember, the goal is to avoid spending more than you receive as income.  You can
                        use the <a href="budget.html">Budget Calculator</a> to see how your income compares to your
                        expenses.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you are spending more money than you are making, look at the different categories
                        to see where you can spend less.  If you are spending less money than you are making, you could
                        add more to your savings, especially if your income fluctuates, or add to any other category.

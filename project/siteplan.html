            <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
            <p>Budgeting is an important skill that is often not well practiced for many reasons. I am not good at
                setting and sticking to a budget. There are many reasons I fail to keep or set a budget that I feel
                many people share:
            <ul>
                <li>Living Paycheck to Paycheck</li>
                <ul class="no-bullet">
                    <li>
                        It can difficult to start to a budget when you feel like you have nothing to work with.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Don't Know Where to Start</li>
                <ul class="no-bullet">
                    <li>
                        Budgeting isn't always taught in school or by parents, so it many people don't know how to get
                        started.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Don't Think a Budget is Important or Will Help</li>
                <ul class="no-bullet">
                    <li>
                        It's easy to think that you're already living frugally, or that your on top of your bills so a
                        budget won't help you.  This in part comes from the idea that a budget is just a way to save money.
                        While that is one reason people create and follow a budget, budgets are a great tool to manage your money.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            I wanted to put together resources about budgeting, specifically some educational material and some
            calculators to help people understand how to budget and give them a place to get started.

            <p>I expect that people with the following questions will find this site helpful:
            <ul>
                <li>How do I start budgeting?</li>
                <li>How can a budget save me money?</li>
                <li>Where is my money going?</li>

            <h2>Color Schema</h2>            
            <div class="box primary"></div>
            <p>My primary color is going to be this green, known as Dollar Bill (and pistachio), #85bb65. You can see it in my headings
                and footers.</p>
            <div class="box secondary"></div>
            <p>My secondary color is pulled from the coin in the logo I threw together with some free assets.  It's #ffb74d, also known as
                Hunyadi Yellow although it's classified as a light orange.  This will be used for headings, and some background color for
                page elements.</p>

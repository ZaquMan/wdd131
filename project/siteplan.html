            <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
            Budgeting is an important skill that is often not well practiced for many reasons. I am not good at
                setting and sticking to a budget. There are many reasons I fail to keep or set a budget that I feel
                many people share:
            <ul>
                <li>Living Paycheck to Paycheck
                <!-- This is an error in the HTML Validator.  Can't nest ULs -->
                <ul class="no-bullet">
                    <li>
                        It can difficult to start to a budget when you feel like you have nothing to work with.
                    </li>
                </ul></li>
                <li>Don't Know Where to Start
                <ul class="no-bullet">
                    <li>
                        Budgeting isn't always taught in school or by parents, so it many people don't know how to get
                        started.
                    </li>
                </ul></li>
                <li>Don't Think a Budget is Important or Will Help
                <ul class="no-bullet">
                    <li>
                        It's easy to think that you're already living frugally, or that your on top of your bills so a
                        budget won't help you. This in part comes from the idea that a budget is just a way to save
                        money.
                        While that is one reason people create and follow a budget, budgets are a great tool to manage
                        your money.
                    </li>
                </ul></li>
            </ul>
            I wanted to put together resources about budgeting, specifically some educational material and some
            calculators to help people understand how to budget and give them a place to get started.

        <div class="scenarios">
            <h2>Scenarios</h2>
            I expect that people with the following questions will find this site helpful:
            <ul>
                <li>How do I start budgeting?</li>
                <li>How can a budget save me money?</li>
                <li>Where is my money going?</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="color-schema">
            <h2>Color Schema</h2>
            <div class="box primary"></div>
            <p>My primary color is going to be this green, known as Dollar Bill (and pistachio), #85bb65. You can see it in my headings and footers.</p>
            <div class="box secondary"></div>
            <p>My secondary color is pulled from the coin in the logo I threw together with some free assets. It's #ffb74d, also known as Hunyadi Yellow although it's classified as a light orange. This will be used for headings, and some
            background color for page elements.</p>
            <!-- Text will be whatever meets AAA accessability -->
            <div class="box primary">Lorem ipsum</div>
            <p>The accent color to pair with the primary color is #0c1909. This is a darker shade of the green ink used for text on money.
            I chose this to keep with the theme of a dollar bill, while improving legibility.</p>
            <div class="box secondary">Lorem ipsum</div>
            <p>My secondary accent color is #3e1e1e, which is a dark or burnt red. I wanted something that would pop more against the yellow than just a dark yellow, and I have that red arrow in my logo, so I went with that.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="typography">
            <h2>Typography</h2>
            <p>There are two planned type faces planned for this project.</p>
            <p>The first is <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ysabeau+SC" target="_blank">Ysabeau SC</a> (don't ask me to pronounce that).  This is used for my headings, specifically H1 and H2 level headings.  I've increased the default weight of H1 headings to 900 to make the text a little 'blockier'.  H2 headings are at the default weight.  If for some reason this font becomes unavailable, then my second font is the firts fallback, with sans-serif as the penultimate fallback.</p>
            <p>My seconf font is <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather+Sans" target="_blank">Merriweather Sans</a>, a solid sans-serif font.  This will be used for all text that isn't a H1 or H2 heading.  I chose it because it's a simple, clean, and easily read font.  I don't want the font to distract from the actual content of the site.  As with the first font, if this font becomes unavailable, the fallback is basic sans-serif.</p>
